## About

This Chrome extension replaces Chrome's default new tab screen with a custom interface designed to promote positivity and meaningful connections.

1. When you open a new tab, NADI's custom interface appears instead of Chrome's default screen (will be deployed soon on chrome store)
2. On first use, the extension generates and stores a UUID locally (Future implementation will use Google popup login via `iframe-web-hosting` package)
3. Includes an admin page for reviewing and approving user-submitted sentences before they appear in the extension

## Development

To run locally:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev:nadi
```
